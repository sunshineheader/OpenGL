GLUS - Modern OpenGL, OpenGL ES and OpenVG Utilities:
-----------------------------------------------------

How to build GLUS and the examples:

1. Install Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers and a GNU Compiler Collection for your operating system.
2. Import GLUS, External and Binaries or VG_Binaries as an existing project.
3. Set the build configuration in Eclipse to your operating system.
4. Build GLUS.
5. Import an example as an existing project.
6. Set the build configuration of the example in Eclipse to your operating system.
7. Build the example.
8. The executable is located in the Binaries or VG_Binaries folder.

If you get build errors:

- Please make sure, that you install all the needed header and libraries.
- Pre-build libraries are located in the External project folder. If you want/need to, replace these libraries with your own build.
- Libraries for the Raspberry PI platform are not included.
- Libraries for the i.MX6 platform are not included.
- Libraries for OpenGL ES and OpenVG are not included.
